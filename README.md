Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the RCM workflow:

**1.Patient Registration**
Collect patient demographics and insurance information.
Verify insurance eligibility and coverage.
Ensure accurate data to avoid claim rejections later.

**2.Insurance Verification**
Confirm insurance is active and covers the planned services.
Obtain pre-authorizations or referrals if required.

**3.Patient Visit / Encounter**
Healthcare services are provided.
Clinical documentation is completed by providers.
